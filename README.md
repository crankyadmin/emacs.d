# Crankyadmin's Emacs Configuration 

## Prerequisites

`Cask` is used for package management.

To install Cask, run this command:

```bash
$ curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cask/cask/master/go | python
```

Or if you are on a Mac, you can install Cask via Homebrew:

```bash
$ brew install cask
```

See <http://cask.readthedocs.io/> for more information

## Installation

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:crankyadmin/emacs.d.git ~/.emacs.d
```

Once this is complete `cd ~/.emacs.d/ && cask` and thats it. Fire up Emacs and be happy!
